1\. \*\*What is Angular?\*\*  
Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. It is used for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.

2\. \*\*What are the key features of Angular 17/18?\*\*  
— Improved performance with Ivy compiler  
— Standalone components  
— Control flow syntax  
— Deferred loading  
— Server-side rendering improvements  
— Enhanced developer tooling

3\. \*\*What is a component in Angular?\*\*  
A component is a fundamental building block of Angular applications. It controls a patch of screen called a view, consisting of a template (HTML), styles (CSS), and a class (TypeScript) that defines behavior.

4\. \*\*What is a module in Angular?\*\*  
A module in Angular is a mechanism to group components, directives, pipes, and services that are related, in such a way that can be combined with other modules to create an application.

5\. \*\*What is the difference between a component and a module?\*\*  
A component controls a patch of screen (view), while a module is a container for a group of related components, directives, pipes, and services.

6\. \*\*What is data binding in Angular?\*\*  
Data binding is a mechanism for coordinating parts of a template with parts of a component. There are four forms of data binding:  
— Interpolation: \`{{ value }}\`  
— Property binding: \`\[property\]=”value”\`  
— Event binding: \`(event)=”handler”\`  
— Two-way binding: \`\[(ngModel)\]=”property”\`

7\. \*\*What is a directive in Angular?\*\*  
A directive is a class that adds additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. There are three kinds of directives:  
— Component directives  
— Structural directives (e.g., \`\*ngIf\`, \`\*ngFor\`)  
— Attribute directives (e.g., \`ngClass\`, \`ngStyle\`)

8\. \*\*What is a pipe in Angular?\*\*  
A pipe is a way to transform data in your template. It takes in data as input and transforms it to the desired output. For example:

```c
{{ birthday | date:’dd/MM/yyyy’ }}
```

9\. \*\*What is dependency injection in Angular?\*\*  
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern and mechanism for creating and delivering some parts of an application to other parts of an application that require them.

10\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`ngOnInit()\`?\*\*  
\`ngOnInit()\` is a lifecycle hook that is called after Angular has initialized all data-bound properties of a directive. It’s used for any additional initialization tasks.

11\. \*\*What is the difference between \`constructor()\` and \`ngOnInit()\`?\*\*  
The \`constructor()\` is called when the class is instantiated, while \`ngOnInit()\` is called after the constructor and after the bindings have been resolved.

12\. \*\*What are Angular services?\*\*  
Services are classes that encapsulate reusable business logic, data sharing, or functionality that doesn’t belong to any specific component.

13\. \*\*What is the purpose of the \`async\` pipe?\*\*  
The \`async\` pipe subscribes to an Observable or Promise and returns the latest value it has emitted. It automatically unsubscribes when the component is destroyed.

14\. \*\*What is the difference between \`Promise\` and \`Observable\`?\*\*  
— \`Promise\` emits a single value  
— \`Observable\` can emit multiple values over time  
— \`Observable\` is cancellable  
— \`Observable\` provides operators like \`map\`, \`filter\`, etc.

15\. \*\*What is AOT compilation?\*\*  
Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation converts your Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build phase, before the browser downloads and runs that code.

16\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`NgZone\` in Angular?\*\*  
\`NgZone\` is a service for executing work inside or outside of the Angular zone. It’s used to optimize performance by reducing the number of change detection cycles.

17\. \*\*What are Angular guards?\*\*  
Guards in Angular are interfaces which can tell the router whether or not it should allow navigation to a requested route. There are five different types of guards:  
— CanActivate  
— CanActivateChild  
— CanDeactivate  
— Resolve  
— CanLoad

18\. \*\*What is lazy loading in Angular?\*\*  
Lazy loading is a technique in Angular where you load JavaScript components asynchronously when a specific route is activated. This helps to decrease the startup time of an application.

19\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`forRoot()\` and \`forChild()\` methods?\*\*  
— \`forRoot()\` is used to configure the root module of the application. It’s typically used in the \`AppModule\`.  
— \`forChild()\` is used in feature modules to register providers without polluting the global injector.

20\. \*\*What are Angular decorators?\*\*  
Decorators are functions that modify JavaScript classes. Angular has many decorators that attach metadata to classes so that it knows what those classes mean and how they should work. Some examples are \` [@Component](http://twitter.com/Component) ()\`, \` [@Injectable](http://twitter.com/Injectable) ()\`, \` [@Input](http://twitter.com/Input) ()\`, etc.

21\. \*\*What is the difference between \`ViewChild\` and \`ContentChild\`?\*\*  
— \`ViewChild\` gives access to elements in the component’s view (template).  
— \`ContentChild\` gives access to elements that are projected into the component (via \`ng-content\`).

22\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`ngOnChanges()\` lifecycle hook?\*\*  
\`ngOnChanges()\` is called when an input property of a component changes. It receives a \`SimpleChanges\` object of current and previous property values.

23\. \*\*What is the difference between \`ngOnChanges()\` and \`ngDoCheck()\`?\*\*  
— \`ngOnChanges()\` is called when an input property changes.  
— \`ngDoCheck()\` is called during every change detection run, even if there are no changes.

24\. \*\*What is change detection in Angular?\*\*  
Change detection is the process that allows Angular to keep our views in sync with our models. It works by checking if the model values have changed after various events (like user events, timers, XHR, promises, etc.).

25\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`TrackBy\` in \`ngFor\` directive?\*\*  
\`TrackBy\` is used to track changes in the iterated array. It can improve performance by minimizing DOM operations when items are added or removed.

```c
<li *ngFor=”let item of items; trackBy: trackByFn”>{{item.name}}</li>
 trackByFn(index: number, item: any): number {
 return item.id;
 }
```

26\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`ngTemplateOutlet\`?\*\*  
\`ngTemplateOutlet\` is used to insert a template in another template. It’s useful for creating reusable template parts.

27\. \*\*What is the difference between \` [@ViewChild](http://twitter.com/ViewChild) ()\` and \` [@ViewChildren](http://twitter.com/ViewChildren) ()\`?\*\*  
— \` [@ViewChild](http://twitter.com/ViewChild) ()\` returns a single element.  
— \` [@ViewChildren](http://twitter.com/ViewChildren) ()\` returns multiple elements as a \`QueryList\`.

28\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`Renderer2\` in Angular?\*\*  
\`Renderer2\` provides a way to manipulate the DOM in a way that’s safe across different platforms (browser, server-side rendering, web workers).

29\. \*\*What is Angular Universal?\*\*  
Angular Universal is a technology that allows you to run Angular applications on the server side, enabling server-side rendering (SSR).

30\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`ng-container\` in Angular?\*\*  
\`ng-container\` is a grouping element that doesn’t interfere with styles or layout because it’s not rendered in the DOM. It’s useful for applying structural directives without adding extra elements to the DOM.

31\. \*\*What is Zone.js and how does it relate to Angular?\*\*  
Zone.js is a library that provides a way to encapsulate and intercept asynchronous activities in the browser. Angular uses Zone.js to automatically detect when to update the view (change detection).

32\. \*\*What is the Ivy renderer in Angular?\*\*  
Ivy is the newest rendering engine for Angular. It generates smaller bundles, provides faster compilation, and improves debugging capabilities.

33\. \*\*What are the main features of Ivy?\*\*  
— Improved build times  
— Smaller bundle sizes  
— Better template type checking  
— Improved debugging experience  
— Easier to read generated code

34\. \*\*What is incremental DOM and how does it relate to Ivy?\*\*  
Incremental DOM is a way of representing the DOM tree using JavaScript. Ivy uses incremental DOM, which allows for tree-shaking and results in smaller bundle sizes.

35\. \*\*What is Angular’s new control flow syntax?\*\*  
Angular 17 introduced a new control flow syntax that replaces \`\*ngIf\`, \`\*ngFor\`, and \`ngSwitch\` with \` [@if](http://twitter.com/if) \`, \` [@for](http://twitter.com/for) \`, and \` [@switch](http://twitter.com/switch) \`. This new syntax is more performant and easier to read.

```c
@if (condition) {
 <p>Condition is true</p>
 } @else {
 <p>Condition is false</p>
 }
 @for (item of items; track item.id) {
 <li>{{item.name}}</li>
 }
 @switch (value) {
 @case (‘A’) { <p>A</p> }
 @case (‘B’) { <p>B</p> }
 @default { <p>Other</p> }
 }
```

36\. \*\*What is Angular’s defer loading feature?\*\*  
Defer loading is a new feature in Angular 17 that allows you to defer the loading of components or blocks of content until they are needed. This can significantly improve initial load times.

```c
@defer {
 <heavy-component />
 } @placeholder {
 <p>Loading…</p>
 }
```

37\. \*\*What are signals in Angular and how do they differ from RxJS observables?\*\*  
Signals are a new reactive primitive introduced in Angular 14. They are simpler than RxJS observables and are designed for representing values that change over time. Unlike observables, signals are always synchronous and don’t have a completion state.

```c
import { signal } from ‘@angular/core’;
 export class MyComponent {
 count = signal(0);
 increment() {
 this.count.update(value => value + 1);
 }
 }
```

38\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`OnPush\` change detection strategy?\*\*  
\`OnPush\` change detection strategy is used to optimize performance by reducing the number of change detection cycles. With this strategy, change detection is only triggered for the component when:  
— An input property changes  
— An event originates from the component or one of its children  
— An Observable bound to the template via the async pipe emits a new value

39\. \*\*What is the difference between \`BehaviorSubject\` and \`Subject\` in RxJS?\*\*  
— \`Subject\` is a basic Subject that emits values to its observers.  
— \`BehaviorSubject\` is a variant of Subject that requires an initial value and always emits its current value to new subscribers.

40\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`switchMap\` operator in RxJS?\*\*  
\`switchMap\` is used to map to an Observable, complete the previous inner Observable, and emit values from the new inner Observable.

```c
import { switchMap } from ‘rxjs/operators’;
 searchTerms$.pipe(
 switchMap(term => this.searchService.search(term))
 ).subscribe(results => this.results = results);
```

41\. \*\*What is the difference between \`mergeMap\` and \`concatMap\` in RxJS?\*\*  
— \`mergeMap\` subscribes to inner Observables concurrently.  
— \`concatMap\` subscribes to inner Observables sequentially, waiting for each to complete before moving to the next.

42\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`catchError\` operator in RxJS?\*\*  
\`catchError\` is used to handle errors in an Observable stream. It catches errors on the source Observable, passing them to a function that returns a new Observable.

```c
import { catchError } from ‘rxjs/operators’;
 import { of } from ‘rxjs’;
 this.http.get(‘api/data’).pipe(
 catchError(error => of([]))
 ).subscribe(data => this.data = data);
```

43\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`shareReplay\` operator in RxJS?\*\*  
\`shareReplay\` is used to share a source Observable with multiple subscribers and replay a specified number of emissions upon subscription.

```c
import { shareReplay } from ‘rxjs/operators’;
 const shared$ = this.http.get(‘api/data’).pipe(
 shareReplay(1)
 );
```

44\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`combineLatest\` in RxJS?\*\*  
\`combineLatest\` combines multiple Observables to create an Observable whose values are calculated from the latest values of each of its input Observables.

```c
import { combineLatest } from ‘rxjs’;
 combineLatest([obs1$, obs2$, obs3$]).subscribe(
 ([val1, val2, val3]) => console.log(val1, val2, val3)
 );
```

45\. \*\*What is the purpose of \`distinctUntilChanged\` in RxJS?\*\*  
\`distinctUntilChanged\` only emits when the current value is different from the last.

```c
import { distinctUntilChanged } from ‘rxjs/operators’;
 obs$.pipe(
 distinctUntilChanged()
 ).subscribe(console.log);
```

46\. \*\*What is state management in Angular applications?\*\*  
State management refers to the management of the state of one or more user interface controls such as text fields, OK buttons, radio buttons, etc. in a graphical user interface.

47\. \*\*What are some popular ==state management libraries for Angular==?\*\*  
— NgRx  
— NGXS  
— Akita  
— Angular signals (built-in)

48\. \*\*What is NgRx and what are its core principles?\*\*  
NgRx is a framework for building reactive applications in Angular. Its core principles are:  
— State is a single, immutable data structure  
— Actions describe state changes  
— Pure functions called reducers take the previous state and the next action to compute the new state  
— State accessed with the \`Store\`, an observable of state and an observer of actions

49\. \*\*What are the main building blocks of NgRx?\*\*  
— Actions  
— Reducers  
— Selectors  
— Effects  
— Store

50\. \*\*What is an Action in NgRx?\*\*  
An Action is an interface that describes an object containing a type and optional payload. Actions are dispatched from components and services to signal state changes.

```c
import { createAction, props } from ‘@ngrx/store’;
 export const increment = createAction(‘[Counter] Increment’);
 export const incrementBy = createAction(
 ‘[Counter] Increment By’,
 props<{ amount: number }>()
 );
```

51\. \*\*What is a Reducer in NgRx?\*\*  
A Reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state.

```c
import { createReducer, on } from ‘@ngrx/store’;
 import { increment, incrementBy } from ‘./counter.actions’;
 export const initialState = 0;
 export const counterReducer = createReducer(
 initialState,
 on(increment, state => state + 1),
 on(incrementBy, (state, { amount }) => state + amount)
 );
```

52\. \*\*What is a Selector in NgRx?\*\*  
A Selector is a pure function used to select, derive and compose pieces of state.

```c
import { createSelector } from ‘@ngrx/store’;
 export const selectFeature = (state: AppState) => state.feature;
 export const selectFeatureCount = createSelector(
 selectFeature,
 (state: FeatureState) => state.count
 );
```

53\. \*\*What are Effects in NgRx?\*\*  
Effects are used to handle side effects in NgRx applications. They listen for dispatched actions and perform side effects, such as making HTTP requests.

```c
import { Injectable } from ‘@angular/core’;
 import { Actions, createEffect, ofType } from ‘@ngrx/effects’;
 import { EMPTY } from ‘rxjs’;
 import { map, mergeMap, catchError } from ‘rxjs/operators’;
 @Injectable()
 export class MovieEffects {
 loadMovies$ = createEffect(() => this.actions$.pipe(
 ofType(‘[Movies Page] Load Movies’),
 mergeMap(() => this.moviesService.getAll()
 .pipe(
 map(movies => ({ type: ‘[Movies API] Movies Loaded Success’, payload: movies })),
 catchError(() => EMPTY)
 ))
 )
 );
 constructor(
 private actions$: Actions,
 private moviesService: MoviesService
 ) {}
 }
```

54\. \*\*What is the Store in NgRx?\*\*  
The Store is a managed container designed to hold application state. It’s an Observable of state and an Observer of actions.

```c
import { Store } from ‘@ngrx/store’;
 import { selectFeatureCount } from ‘./selectors’;
 export class MyComponent {
 count$: Observable<number>;
 constructor(private store: Store) {
 this.count$ = this.store.select(selectFeatureCount);
 }
 increment() {
 this.store.dispatch({ type: ‘[Counter] Increment’ });
 }
 }
```

55\. \*\*What is the difference between NgRx and NGXS?\*\*  
While both are state management solutions for Angular:  
— NgRx follows a Redux-like pattern with actions, reducers, and effects.  
— NGXS uses a class-based approach with state classes and action handlers.  
NGXS is often considered more straightforward and requires less boilerplate code.

56\. \*\*What is Akita and how does it differ from NgRx?\*\*  
Akita is another state management library for Angular. Unlike NgRx:  
— Akita uses object-oriented design principles.  
— It has built-in support for normalized state.  
— It doesn’t require actions for every state change.  
— It provides powerful tools for state queries.

57\. \*\*How can you implement optimistic updates with NgRx?\*\*  
Optimistic updates involve updating the UI before the server confirms the change. Here’s a basic approach:

```c
@Effect()
 updateTodo$ = this.actions$.pipe(
 ofType(‘[Todo] Update’),
 mergeMap(action => {
 this.store.dispatch(new OptimisticUpdateSuccess(action.payload));
 return this.todoService.update(action.payload).pipe(
 map(() => new UpdateSuccess(action.payload)),
 catchError(error => of(new UpdateFailed(error, action.payload)))
 );
 })
 );
```

58\. \*\*What are the benefits of using NgRx in large-scale applications?\*\*  
— Centralized, immutable state management  
— Predictable state changes through pure functions  
— Powerful dev tools for time-travel debugging  
— Scalable architecture for managing complex state interactions  
— Clear separation of concerns  
— Improved testability

59\. \*\*How do you handle loading states in NgRx?\*\*  
One common approach is to include loading flags in your state:

```c
export interface AppState {
 todos: {
 items: Todo[];
 loading: boolean;
 error: string | null;
 }
 }
```

60\. \*\*What is the purpose of the \`createFeatureSelector\` function in NgRx?\*\*  
\`createFeatureSelector\` is a convenience function that returns a typed selector function for a feature slice of state.

```c
import { createFeatureSelector } from ‘@ngrx/store’;
 export const selectFeature = createFeatureSelector<FeatureState>(‘feature’);
```

61\. \*\*How do you test NgRx reducers?\*\*  
Reducers are pure functions, so they can be tested by providing an initial state and an action, and asserting on the returned state.

```c
describe(‘counterReducer’, () => {
 it(‘should increment the count’, () => {
 const initialState = 0;
 const action = increment();
 const result = counterReducer(initialState, action);
 expect(result).toBe(1);
 });
 });
```

62\. \*\*What is the purpose of the \` [@ngrx/entity](http://twitter.com/ngrx/entity) \` package?\*\*  
\` [@ngrx/entity](http://twitter.com/ngrx/entity) \` provides a set of utility functions for managing record collections. It reduces boilerplate for creating reducers that manage a collection of models.

63\. \*\*How do you handle side effects in NGXS?\*\*  
In NGXS, side effects are handled using the \` [@Action](http://twitter.com/Action) \` decorator within state classes:

```c
@State<string[]>({
 name: ‘todos’,
 defaults: []
 })
 @Injectable()
 export class TodosState {
 @Action(AddTodo)
 add(ctx: StateContext<string[]>, action: AddTodo) {
 const state = ctx.getState();
 ctx.setState([…state, action.payload]);
 }
 }
```

64\. \*\*What is the difference between \`dispatch\` and \`patchState\` in NGXS?\*\*  
— \`dispatch\` is used to dispatch actions, which can trigger state changes and side effects.  
— \`patchState\` is used to directly update the state without going through the action -> reducer flow.

65\. \*\*How do you implement lazy loading with NgRx?\*\*  
NgRx supports lazy loading through feature modules. You can use \`StoreModule.forFeature()\` in your lazy-loaded module:

```c
@NgModule({
 imports: [
 StoreModule.forFeature(‘featureName’, featureReducer),
 EffectsModule.forFeature([FeatureEffects])
 ]
 })
 export class FeatureModule { }
```

66\. \*\*What is the purpose of the \` [@ngrx/component-store](http://twitter.com/ngrx/component-store) \` package?\*\*  
\` [@ngrx/component-store](http://twitter.com/ngrx/component-store) \` is a standalone library for managing local component state. It’s useful for managing state that doesn’t need to be shared across the entire application.

67\. \*\*How do you handle complex state derivation in NgRx?\*\*  
Complex state derivation can be handled using memoized selectors:

```c
export const selectCompletedTodos = createSelector(
 selectAllTodos,
 (todos) => todos.filter(todo => todo.completed)
 );
```

68\. \*\*What is the purpose of the \` [@ngrx/router-store](http://twitter.com/ngrx/router-store) \` package?\*\*  
\` [@ngrx/router-store](http://twitter.com/ngrx/router-store) \` provides bindings to connect the Angular Router with the NgRx store. This allows you to handle router state within your NgRx application.

69\. \*\*How do you handle asynchronous state updates in Akita?\*\*  
Akita provides a \`transaction\` method for handling asynchronous updates:

```c
this.todosService.add({ id: 1, title: ‘New Todo’ }).pipe(
 tap(() => this.todosStore.setLoading(true)),
 finalize(() => this.todosStore.setLoading(false))
 ).subscribe(
 todo => this.todosStore.add(todo),
 error => this.todosStore.setError(error)
 );
```

70\. \*\*What is the purpose of the \` [@ngrx/data](http://twitter.com/ngrx/data) \` package?\*\*  
\` [@ngrx/data](http://twitter.com/ngrx/data) \` is an extension that offers a simplified approach to managing entity data in NgRx applications. It reduces the amount of code you need to write for common data operations.

71\. \*\*How do you implement undo/redo functionality with NgRx?\*\*  
Undo/redo can be implemented by storing previous states in an array and using actions to navigate through this array:

```c
export interface UndoableState<T> {
 past: T[];
 present: T;
 future: T[];
 }
```

72\. \*\*What is the purpose of the \`createSelector\` function in NgRx?\*\*  
\`createSelector\` is used to create memoized selectors that are composable. It can significantly improve performance by avoiding unnecessary recomputations.

73\. \*\*How do you handle form state management with NgRx?\*\*  
NgRx can be used to manage form state by dispatching actions on form events and updating the state accordingly. The \` [@ngrx/forms](http://twitter.com/ngrx/forms) \` package also provides utilities for this purpose.

74\. \*\*What is the difference between \`effects\` and \`epics\` in state management?\*\*  
— Effects (NgRx) are used to handle side effects in Angular applications.  
— Epics (Redux-Observable) serve a similar purpose but are based on RxJS observables and are typically used in React applications.

75\. \*\*How do you handle server-side rendering (SSR) with NgRx?\*\*  
For SSR with NgRx, you typically need to:  
1\. Create an initial state on the server.  
2\. Serialize and transfer this state to the client.  
3\. Initialize the client-side store with this transferred state.

```c
// On the server
 const serverState = {…};
 // Transfer to client (e.g., in a script tag)
 // On the client
 const initialState = window[‘INITIAL_STATE’];
 StoreModule.forRoot(reducers, { initialState })
```
